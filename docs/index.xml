      <description>Hi, I am Manas.
I grew up in a town called Kolhapur in Maharashtra, India. I have been interested in Maths since I was a kid. So I decided to pursue my career in Mathematics and did my undergrad in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Guwahati. During my undergrad, I was introduced to the application of Maths in Finance, which I found pretty intriguing, and I decided to pursue higher studies in the field.</description>

      <description>Building a Tax-Efficient Portfolio ● We built a optimization-based tax-aware portfolio construction method that adds tax liability to standard Markowitz-based portfolio construction. Our method produces a trade list that specifies the number of shares to buy of each asset and the number of shares to sell from each tax lot held.
● To avoid wash sales (in which some realized capital losses are disallowed), we assume that we trade monthly, and cannot simultaneously buy and sell the same asset.</description>
