Hi, I am Manas.

I grew up in a town called Kolhapur in Maharashtra, India. I have been interested in Maths since I was a kid. So I decided to pursue my career in Mathematics and did my undergrad in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Guwahati. During my undergrad, I was introduced to the application of Maths in Finance, which I found pretty intriguing, and I decided to pursue higher studies in the field.
Currently, I am pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Financial Engineering from Cornell University.
